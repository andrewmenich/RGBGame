# RGB - Color Matching Game

### This was a code-along with Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp on Udemy. 

I added my own CSS and some custom functionality to the game that wasn't part of the code-along challenge. Namely, I added an additional difficulty, as well as functionality that reset the box background colors no matter what button is used to start a new game.
